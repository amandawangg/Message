      Or you will just be busy with spreadsheets ü•≤ I think if I had WiFi I would just stay chatting with you tho o.o <br>

      On the bright side, I am happy to see my family after 2 years not seeing them. I am also grateful to go on a trip with them. Even though I don't get to see u for 6 weeks, I know we will be fine and I will try my best to make time and video call u everyday even in Singapore <br>
