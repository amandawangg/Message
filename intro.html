    <h1>üéÅ Welcome to your surprise! üéÅ</h1>
    <p> This is how it works: <br>

      <br>
      You get to open one for each hour starting at 11am on May 19th, 2023. I originally was going to do this via schedule email but I realized it's not going to work without the internet ü•≤ <br> 

      <br>
      I don't know if I will have WiFi or not so this is like my backup plan to keep u company. This only works if you remember to check it tho but I trust u on that. I should have WiFi tho since I confirmed with the airline so hopefully we can chat throughout the flight which would be rlly nice. But we'll see... :) <br>

      <br>
      Now, head to surprise section in the main page and open up the first one ‚ÄúHour 0‚Äù when it's May 19th 11am </p>
    <br>
