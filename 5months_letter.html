    <h1>5 month letter üíå</h1>
    <p>Happy 5 months to us :) </p>

    <p>
      In these 5 months, I have definitely grown as a person. Every month these letters feel like writing a reflection at a therapy session. But hey, it's free therapy üòÇ and this is going to be a short letter. I know I say this often but I am really grateful for you every day. This sounds cheesy but life with you feels a lot better :)
    </p>

    <p>
      I feel like I have grown into a more grounded person and you definitely have contributed to that growth as well. I remember when we first started dating I worried about things not working out often. It‚Äôs safe to say it comes from my insecurities. I think part of me always thinks I am not good enough for something or someone. There are reasons why I think this way: 1) I never felt like I was good enough for my parents because nothing I do/did seem to be good enough for them; there‚Äôs always something I could‚Äôve done better 2) related to the first reason but never being the ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù or the 1st place in anything 3) being rejected by someone
    </p>

    <p>
      I was scared that I wasn‚Äôt going to be good enough for you but these 5 months made me feel grounded in our relationship. I genuinely feel like we have a solid foundation now and I am not really scared about that anymore. All the time I have spent with you and all the caring words you have said have made me feel loved and reassured that I might finally be good enough for someone. I guess I have been trying to be good enough for something for as far as I can remember and it‚Äôs kinda hard to believe sometimes that I am enough for someone.

      In these 5 months, I have also learned that you will always be there for me whenever I need you. For example, when I was sick a few weeks ago. Usually, when I am sick, I feel sad especially when I feel like I have no support here since I am away from home. I remember feeling like this last year and it was the worst feeling I don‚Äôt wish to ever feel again. This year is different because of you :) You make me feel a little stronger and grounded even when you are not physically present. Even when I was lowkey dying ü•≤ when I woke up in the middle of the night, I thought about you and how I wished you were here but just imagining that you were cuddling me made me feel safe and gave me the ‚Äúeverything thing will be better soon‚Äù feeling. And that was enough to make me fall asleep again. Your hugs when I was sick gave me the energy to keep the day going instead of lying in bed and being sad. You gave me the support I needed :)) And because of you, life sucks a little less (okay, maybe a lot less XD)
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope I give you the support you need too and I also hope we will keep supporting each other in whatever way in the future. I can‚Äôt wait to give you a nice big hug tomorrow to say I appreciate you a lot and go on a nice little date with you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
    </p>

      I love you ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
