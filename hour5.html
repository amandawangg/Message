    <h1> üïì Hour 5: 4pm PST</h1>

    <p>
      If I am not napping I definitely should by now and an hour of work left for you. 
      <br> 

      <br> 
      You know back then, I didn't think I would do long distance at all bc I would hate it and I need physical touch ü•∫ 
      <br>
      
      <br>
      I still have no clue how I am going to survive without your hugs but I know this is only temporary :p I will give you loads of hugs and kisses when I am back :)) Here's also something I wanna ask you to do: you can tell me anything that's bothering you or if you are feeling sad or anything in general. I realized we need to communicate well with each other even more now since we will be far away from each other. <br>

      <br>
      Last hour of work! Then, you get to go home :))<br>
      </p>
